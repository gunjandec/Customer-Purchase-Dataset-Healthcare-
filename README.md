# Customer Purchase Dataset (Healthcare) Project
## Project Description
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Customer Purchase Dataset specifically within the healthcare sector. The objective is to derive meaningful insights and visualize the data to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and other relevant trends in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customer purchases in the healthcare industry. The key features include:

Customer ID
Age
Gender
Product ID
Product Category
Purchase Amount
Purchase Date
Other demographic and transactional features
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the data. The following steps were performed as part of the EDA:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other summary statistics to understand the data distribution.
Data Visualization: Using various visualization techniques to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. Some of the visualizations include:
Histograms and bar charts to show the distribution of age, gender, and purchase amount.
Box plots to identify outliers in purchase amounts.
Scatter plots to visualize relationships between different features.
Heatmaps to show correlations between features.
Key Findings
From the EDA, several key insights were derived, including:

Demographic Insights: Age and gender distribution of customers, most frequent age groups making purchases, and gender-based purchasing trends.
Product Insights: Most popular product categories, highest-selling products, and seasonal trends in product purchases.
Purchase Patterns: Average purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and high-value customers.
## Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of EDA and visualization in uncovering valuable insights from a Customer Purchase Dataset in the healthcare sector. By understanding customer behavior and purchasing patterns, businesses can make informed decisions and strategize effectively.
